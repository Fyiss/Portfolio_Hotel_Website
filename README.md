# Portfolio_Hotel_Website
Portfolio hotel website
Xampp server is needed to implement the use of backend.
localhost:8080/phpmyadmin can be used to check the backend datatbase.(php files and code are included for that reason.)
localhost:8080/php is needed for entering the user details and storing them in the backend database.
(Was not able to host the live website due to reasons,so please refer the code in the main repository)
